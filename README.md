Mr. Potato Head

I'm very sorry that I didn't get there. I had a very hectic, personal week and in addition I didn't really get the hang of 
androidstudio until it was too late. I think I might be on the right track, but my cleaning and rebuilding is taking ages so 
I'm not all too sure. As of now, my program won't recognise the "R". It said online to clean and rebuild but it's not working 
out so well. I feel awful about it, but I guess submitting something is better than nothing. I'll do better next week.
