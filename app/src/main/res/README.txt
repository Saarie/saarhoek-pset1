I'm sorry that this isn't finished whatsoever. It took me a while to get the hang of everything
and my week was so hectic that it was too late once I could really get to it.
No excuses though, my fault. The building and the cleaning took ages and I'm not really sure
as to if I'm even in the right direction.
I'll do better next week!
